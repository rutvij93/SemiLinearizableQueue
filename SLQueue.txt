java QueueTest <qname> <threads> <duration> [<n>]

where qname is either LQueue for linearizable queue or SLQueue for semilinearizable
queue, threads > 0 is the number of test threads, duration > 0
is the duration of the test in seconds and n is the value of n for the semilinearizable
queue (n is not required when LQueue is supplied as the qname).
Each thread should perform both enqueue and dequeue repeatedly with equal
probability.
